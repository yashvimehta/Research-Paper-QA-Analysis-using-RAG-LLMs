The capstone project introduces an intelligent system for research paper interaction, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combined with Meta’s LLaMA language model to address these challenges. The system supports two primary tasks: question answering (QA) and summarization. By grounding generative responses in the original research paper content, the system ensures accuracy and relevance, addressing the limitations of standalone large language models (LLMs), such as hallucination and domain inaccuracy. The methodology involves preprocessing documents into manageable chunks, embedding them for semantic understanding, and applying RAG to retrieve contextually relevant content for user queries. Rigorous evaluations using metrics like coverage, perplexity, factual consistency, and BERT scores demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in producing concise and coherent outputs. The results highlight the potential of this approach to transform academic workflows by enabling precise and accessible engagement with research literature. Future work explores expanding functionality to include diverse document types and specialized domains.
